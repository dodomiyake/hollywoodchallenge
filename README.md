# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is my solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). The challenge was to build a responsive product card that looks great on both mobile and desktop devices and includes accessible interactive elements.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Clearly distinguish between current and original prices
- Interact with a responsive and accessible call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- React (Functional Components)
- Utility-first CSS design (Tailwind best practices)

### What I learned

This challenge helped me solidify my understanding of:

- Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive layout using `md:` breakpoints
- Tailwindâ€™s `object-cover`, `rounded-*`, and spacing utilities
- How to handle image rendering for different breakpoints
- Accessibility best practices: `hover`, `focus`, and `alt` attributes

Hereâ€™s a snippet Iâ€™m particularly proud of â€” it ensures the image fits for desktop and mobile:

```jsx
<figure className="h-[240px] md:h-auto md:w-1/2">
    <img
        src={productImg}
        alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum"
        className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
</figure>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore accessible animation and focus outlines
- Create a component system for scaling designs like this
- Use TypeScript for more type safety in components
- Build reusable design tokens into Tailwindâ€™s config for even more consistency
